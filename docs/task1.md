# Introduction
Modern technology has made it possible to communicate and interact with people from all over the world, which has opened up countless avenues for global teams and workforces. With the increase in communicative technology, more and more people are communicating with each-other every day - meaning its becoming increasingly difficult to keep track of different peoples contact details by head or by hand. The average human will only be able to remember a handful of emails and phone numbers at any one time which limits outreach potential immensely. To solve this problem, I propose a bespoke contact keeping software called an Addressbook. It will allow users to store and interact with as many contacts as they like, without limitations.

## How will this benefit the end users?

By implementing this software, users will :
 - Be able to store 50+ contacts at once, and be able to view them all with a single command
 - No longer have to rummage through notebooks to find a particular set of contact details.
 - Be able to edit, add and remove contacts in a centralised platform
 - No longer have to worry about losing physical contact stores during events such as fires and earthquakes.


## How will this benefit you?
 - *Increased Productivity*: By centralising contact information, the application can save employees time that would otherwise be spent searching for contact details. This allows employees to focus more on core tasks and less on administrative duties.
 - *Scalability*: As a business grows, its contact database can expand significantly. An address book application can easily scale to accommodate more contacts and more complex relationships.
 - *Increased Revenue*: If marketed well, the address book application can generate additional revenue streams for the business through subscriptions, one-time purchases, or freemium models.


## Conclusion
The AddressBook application serves as a comprehensive solution for managing contact information. It provides a centralised platform for storing, retrieving, and modifying contact details, thereby enhancing productivity and scalability. With its robust search functionality, users can easily find contacts by name or phone number. The application's design ensures it can scale with the growth of a user's contact database, making it a reliable and efficient tool for personal and professional use.
